Case Solved!
Great detective work! Thomas Brown has confessed to the crime.

Case Explanation
The investigation started with two suspects from the crime scene, one living on Ocean Drive and the other with a name ending in "ez". After interviewing them, hotel check-ins were filtered using two separate cluesâ€”first by date, then further refined using surveillance records. Only three people matched both filters. An interview with each of them revealed their role in the case, and after pressing further, Thomas Brown confessed to the crime.
